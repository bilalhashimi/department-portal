                    This document outlines essential security practices for database administrators and developers.
                    
                    Authentication and authorization mechanisms should be implemented to control access to database resources. 
                    Use strong passwords, multi-factor authentication, and role-based access control to limit user privileges. 
                    Regular security audits help identify vulnerabilities and ensure compliance with security policies.
                    
                    Encryption at rest and in transit protects data from unauthorized access. Implement SSL/TLS for network 
                    communications and encrypt sensitive columns or entire databases. Regular backups and disaster recovery 
                    plans ensure business continuity in case of security incidents.
                    
                    SQL injection attacks can be prevented through parameterized queries and input validation. Regular 
                    security updates and patches should be applied to database management systems. Monitor database activity 
                    logs for suspicious behavior and unauthorized access attempts.
