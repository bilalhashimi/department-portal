                    Effective incident response is critical for minimizing the impact of cybersecurity threats and 
                    maintaining business operations. This plan outlines step-by-step procedures for handling security incidents.
                    
                    Incident identification involves monitoring security logs, alerts, and user reports to detect 
                    potential security breaches. Automated threat detection systems and Security Information and 
                    Event Management (SIEM) tools help identify suspicious activities.
                    
                    Upon incident detection, the response team should immediately contain the threat to prevent 
                    further damage. Isolate affected systems, preserve evidence, and document all actions taken 
                    during the response process.
                    
                    Communication protocols ensure timely notification of stakeholders, including management, 
                    legal teams, and potentially affected customers. Transparency and clear communication help 
                    maintain trust and comply with regulatory requirements.
                    
                    Post-incident analysis identifies root causes, evaluates response effectiveness, and implements 
                    improvements to prevent similar incidents. Regular tabletop exercises and incident response 
                    training keep the team prepared for various threat scenarios.
