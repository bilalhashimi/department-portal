                    Cloud computing has transformed how organizations design and deploy applications. This document explores 
                    common architectural patterns and best practices for cloud-native applications.
                    
                    Microservices architecture enables scalable and maintainable applications by decomposing monolithic 
                    systems into smaller, independent services. Each microservice can be developed, deployed, and scaled 
                    independently, improving overall system resilience and flexibility.
                    
                    Containerization with Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes provide consistent deployment environments 
                    and automated scaling capabilities. Service mesh technologies like Istio enable secure communication 
                    between microservices and provide observability features.
                    
                    Serverless computing allows developers to focus on business logic without managing infrastructure. 
                    Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms automatically scale based on demand and charge only for 
                    actual usage, making them cost-effective for event-driven applications.
                    
                    DevOps practices, including continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), enable rapid 
                    and reliable software delivery. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform ensure consistent 
                    and reproducible infrastructure deployments.
